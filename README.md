# BME3053c Final Project
Team Name: Team ECG Coders
Team Members: Elizabeth Bucher, Eliana Jaffa, David Zaibert
Description: This repository includes the dataset and code used to create our final project in MATLAB. The project uses machine learning to analyze and predict abnormal ECG Data. The program is run in the .mlx file, Final_Project_MATLAB.mlx, where the data set 'ecg.csv' can be imported and then used in the classifier. The code creates a training model for normal and abnormal ECG waves based on the data labels 1 and 0. The trainer utilizes the MATLAB classification learner application to create a function 'trainClassifer', which can be found in the file trainClassifier.m.
